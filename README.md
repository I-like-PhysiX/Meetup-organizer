# Meetup-organizer

> A Vuejs website, where only signed up users can register, create and modify existing meetups. Those people who don't have any permission can view these meetups. This website is designed for practicing and testing. Please do not spam! CAUTION! This website accepts fake and real (valid) email addresses. Please use the fake ones because "delete user" function is not implemented (yet)!

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
